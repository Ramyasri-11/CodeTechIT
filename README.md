    /*TO-DO List Documentation*/
This HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code creates a simple To-Do List application with functionality to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Here's how it works:

HTML:
The HTML structure consists of a header displaying the title "My To Do List", a form for adding tasks, a select element for filtering tasks, and a div to contain the list of tasks.

The form includes an input field for entering tasks and a button to submit the task.
The select element allows users to filter tasks by "All", "Completed", or "Incomplete".
The todo-list ul element is where the tasks will be displayed.

CSS:
The CSS file styles the appearance of the application, including fonts, colors, and layout.
It defines styles for the header, form, input field, buttons, and the todo list.
Styling is also applied for the completed tasks, with a strike-through effect.

JavaScript:
The JavaScript file handles the dynamic functionality of the application.
It starts by selecting various elements from the HTML document.
Event listeners are added to the form submit button, todo list, and filter dropdown.
When the user submits a task, a new list item (li) is created with the entered task text.

Buttons for completing and deleting tasks are appended to each list item.
Functions are defined to handle adding tasks to local storage, retrieving tasks from local storage, and removing tasks from local storage.
Event delegation is used to handle clicks on the todo list items' buttons, allowing for dynamic addition and removal of tasks.
Filtering functionality allows users to show all tasks, completed tasks, or incomplete tasks based on their selection from the dropdown menu.
Overall, this code creates a functional To-Do List application that allows users to manage their tasks easily.


        /*Weather forecast*/
This HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code creates a simple weather application that allows users to search for weather information by city name. Here's how it works:

HTML:
The HTML structure consists of a container div with various elements inside it.
There's an input field for entering the city name, an icon for submitting the search, and placeholders for displaying weather-related information such as temperature, city name, humidity, and wind speed.

CSS:
The CSS file styles the appearance of the application, including fonts, colors, layout, and responsiveness.
It defines styles for the container, search box, input field, icons, weather details, and error message (which is currently commented out).

JavaScript:
The JavaScript file handles the dynamic functionality of the application.
It starts by selecting various elements from the HTML document.

An asynchronous function checkWeather(city) is defined to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the provided city name.
Upon receiving the response, the function updates the HTML content with the fetched weather information such as temperature, city name, humidity, and wind speed.
Depending on the weather conditions (e.g., Clouds, Clear, Rain, etc.), the appropriate weather image is displayed.
Event listener is added to the search icon (serchbox) to trigger the weather search when clicked.

When the search icon is clicked, it retrieves the value entered in the input field (searchinput) and passes it to the checkWeather function.
Finally, the weather data is displayed on the webpage, and the visibility of weather details is toggled to make them visible (display='flex').
Overall, this code creates a functional weather application that fetches and displays weather information based on user input.
